# Intro

**Disclaimer!**
This is my code for completing the Advent of Code 2025. It's not optimal and simply a solution to the question. 
I do these to relax and have fun and have not spent any time researching how to reduce the Big O notation.

## Language
The code is written in Python.

## Organization
Every day is placed inside it's own folder.
Each day consists of two tasks, each have their own respective script file (even if the tasks are very similar or build upon eachother).
The tasks are pasted from the Advent of Code website into the Rules.md file per day.
